# hello-world
New Here!
Hi, I'm Antonio and a beginner coder trying to learn as much as possible and with this experience hopefully if possible find a career with what I've learned over the time I've spent here. As of now 2/28/2018 I have only covered the basics in HTML, C++ and JavaScript, soon with a little time I will have the necessary skills to begin my own projects and start a decent portfolio!
